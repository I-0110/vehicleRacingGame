# VEHICLE RACING GAME

## Description

Our Vehicle Racing Game is inspired by the highly demand of our customers who loves motorbikes. We created this project because we love racing cars. Then, our custumers sent us ideas and suggestions to add a motorbike race   as well. We resolved not having a truck to tow cars and motobikes. We learned that if/else if statements can be powerful. Also, how nested if can work.
